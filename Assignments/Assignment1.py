#  Program : Even or Odd
#  Description : A program that checks if two numbers multiplied together are even or odd
#  VARIABLE DICTIONARY:
#  a (int) = user inputted number, used for calculations in different parts of the program  
#  b (int) = second user inputted number, used for multiplication in even/odd detection  
#  d (float) = calculated inner diagonal of a cube  
#  quarters (int) = number of quarters in the change  
#  dimes (int) = number of dimes in the change  
#  nickles (int) = number of nickels in the change  
#  pennies (int) = number of pennies in the change  
#  change (int) = remaining amount of change in cents during calculation  
#  total (int) = original amount of change input by user  

# Part 1: 

print("Welcome to the even and odd detector!")
print("This program determines if the product of two whole positive numbers will be even or odd!")
# Prints out description of what is required for program to do

a = int(input("Please enter your first number: "))
# Asks for the users input for the first number
b = int(input("Please enter your second number: "))
# Ask for the unders input for the second number

if (a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1):
  # Checks if both the first and second number are odd
  print("The product ", a, "x", b, " will be odd.")
  # Prints out the result of the 2 numbers will be odd because both  numbers are odd
  
elif (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0):
  # Checks if both the first number and second number is odd
  print("The product ", a, "x", b, " will be even.")
  # Prints out the result of the 2 numbers will be even since both the numbers are even

elif (a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 0):
  # Checks if the first number is odd and if the second number is even
  print("The product ", a, "x", b, " will be even.")
  # Prints out the result of the 2 numbers will be even since one of the numbers is even and one of them numbers is odd
  
else:
  print("The product ", a, "x", b, " will be even.")
  # It will run when the first number is even and the second number is odd

# Part 2: The inner (or body) diagonal of a cube

#  Program : Calculate the inner (or body) diagonal of a cube
#  Description : This program calculates the inner or body diagonal of a cube

import math

print("I can calculate the cube's inner diagonal for any edge length.")
# Prints out description of what the program will do

a = int(input("Enter the edge length of your cube:"))
# Asks user for number as an edge length for the cube
d = a * math.sqrt(3)
# Calculates the diagonal of the cube by using the number the user inputted 
d = round(d, 2)
# Rounds the value of the diagonal for the cube to 2 decimal places

print("The length of the inner diagonal of a cube with the side length %.f will be: %.2f" % (a,d))
# Prints out the length of the inner diagonal of the cube with the side length the user put
