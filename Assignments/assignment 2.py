Program : Number Guessing Game
Description : A game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within 6 tries.

VARIABLE DICTIONARY :
random_number (int) = Stores the randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
attempts (int) = Tracks the number of guesses the user has made.
max_attempts (int) = The maximum number of guesses allowed (6).
game_over (bool) = A boolean flag to control whether the game loop should continue or end.
user_input (int) = Stores the number input by the user on each guess.
