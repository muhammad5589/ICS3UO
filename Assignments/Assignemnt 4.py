Description : searches inside wordle file to get word or date ouput

VARIABLE DICTIONARY :
data_rows (list) = stores each line of the file as a list: [Month, Day, Year, Word]
all_dates (list) = stores all dates in integer YYYYMMDD format
all_words (list) = stores all the words from the file
month_array (list) = contains month abbreviations used to convert month names to numbers
fh (file object) = used to open and read the wordle.dat file
line (str) = temporarily stores a line read from the file before processing
eof (bool) = flag used to detect the end of the file while reading lines
temp_month (str) = 3-letter abbreviation of the month passed into combine_date_parts()
temp_day (str) = day portion passed into combine_date_parts()
temp_year (str) = year portion passed into combine_date_parts()
numerical_date (int) = result of combining month, day, and year into YYYYMMDD format
i (int) = loop counter used for iterating through data_rows and all_words
m (int) = loop counter used for iterating through data_rows for extracting words
search_word (str) = word input by the user when searching for a date
counter (int) = flag used to indicate if the word was found in find_word_date()
month (str) = parameter passed to get_word_by_date() representing the month
day (str) = parameter passed to get_word_by_date() representing the day
year (str) = parameter passed to get_word_by_date() representing the year
input_date (int) = result of merging parameters in get_word_by_date() to numerical form
date (int) = current date being checked inside the for-loop of get_word_by_date()
choice (str) = user input for selecting either word or date search ("w" or "d")
w (str) = stores the word input by the user if searching by word
user_year (str) = stores the year input by the user when searching by date
user_month (str) = stores the month input by the user when searching by date
user_day (str) = stores the day input by the user when searching by date
formatted_date (int) = result of combining user_month, user_day, and user_year
