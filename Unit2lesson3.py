# Task A
# I think that it will output:
# Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!
# It's possible Sanjay can distribute  12
#  cookies for each bowl.

# When I ran the program, my prediction was correct
# Fix the program so that there is only one space before and after the "12":
print("Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!")
print("It's possible Sanjay can distribute", 12)
print("cookies for each bowl.")

# Task B:
print("Sanjay has", 6, "bowls for", 144, "cookies")
# However you can also do,
print("Sanjay has %d bowls for %d cookies" % (6, 144))

# Task C:
print("The number of cookies per bowl is:", 144/6)
# There is one text value and one number value (two numbers being divided with the / operator)
