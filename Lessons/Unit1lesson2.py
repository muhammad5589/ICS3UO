# Predict:
# I would expect that print(24) would output 24
# Run:
# My prediction was correct and it output 24
# Modify:
amount = 24
print("Two dozen is: ", amount)
# Using the variable amount can help with readability of the code and printing "Two dozen is: " helps give more feedback and information when running it
# Modify 2:
amount = 7 * 4
print("forty-two is: ", amount)
# The fixed output would be
amount = 7 * 4
print("twenty-eight is: ", amount)
# or
amount = 7 * 6
print("forty-two is: ", amount)
# Modify 3:
amount = 8
amount += 1
print("The amount is: ", amount)
# amount = amount + 1 is taking the value of the amount variable and adding one to it so 8 + 1 = 9
# amount += 1 works the same way and adds 1 to the value of amount
# Modify 4:
amount = 8
amount *= 2
print(amount)
# amount = amount * 2 is taking the value of amount and multiplying it by two, in this case doubling the value
# amount *= 2 works the same way and multiplies the amount value by 2
