Program : Number Guessing Game
Description : A game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within 6 tries.
VARIABLE DICTIONARY :
correct_numb (int) = Stores the randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
guesscount (int) = Tracks the number of guesses the user has made.
max_tries (int) = The maximum number of guesses allowed (6).
u_guess (int) = Stores the number input by the user on each guess.
